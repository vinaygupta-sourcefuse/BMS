maintain Single responsibilty among classes and try to implement Valdation class seprately!!

i have to implement interface and genrics in BMS 

interfaces for deciding the rules/ contract for different types of modals like  PrintedBooks, E-Book, Magazine and Reasearch Paper (if interface get more bigger than we can break it using Interface Seggrigation Principle) and using interface try to implement open/ close principle 

generics for making this BookManager Class as a LSP(Liskov substitution Principal) so that i can use this class as template for performing these operation on PrintedBooks, E-Book, Magazine and Reasearch Paper

learn CI/ CD only theory part 

we will understand later about Dependency inversion and decorators
